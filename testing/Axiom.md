#! Axiom

Create technical content quickly and simply: use **markdown** syntax for styling

Use $latex$ for math and equations:

$$ [id=sum] \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i}

Fast and intelligent hyperlinking: @[sum]

Create latex like environments:

>>! theorem [id=primes] There are like infinity many primes, or, like, you know, whatever...

Referencing environments is also easy @[primes]
