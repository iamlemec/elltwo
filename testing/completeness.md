#! Completeness

The *completeness axiom* for [[preference relation|preference relations]] states that any two objects can be compared. Being a necessary condition for a relation to be represented by a utility function, it is widely employed and stands as one of the fundamental axioms of rationality. Nonetheless, there is a large interest in understanding decision theory without completeness.

>>! axiom* [completeness|name=completeness] A binary relation $\succcurlyeq$ over a set $X$ is *complete* if for all $x,y \in X$, either $x \succcurlyeq y$ or $y \succcurlyeq x$.
