#! Transitivity

The *transitivity axiom* for [[preference relation|preference relations]] states that for any three alternatives, $x$, $y$, and $z$, if $x$ is preferred to $y$ and $y$ to $z$ then also $x$ is preferred to $z$. Being a necessary condition for a relation to be represented by a utility function, it is widely employed and stands as one of the fundamental axioms of rationality.

>>! axiom* [transitivity|name=rt=transitivity] A binary relation $\succcurlyeq$ over a set $X$ is *transitive* if for all $x,y,z \in X$, if $x \succcurlyeq y$ and $y \succcurlyeq z$ then $x \succcurlyeq z$.

Transitivity is a notion of local consistency, and has a strong normative appeal; a DM whose preferences are intransitive is exposed to *dutch book* or *money pump* schemes that can extract her wealth.

Transitivity is often assumed to hold for both the strict and weak component of preference. However, when weakened, it is more often relaxed in the context of indifference. For example a model of interval valued utility, where alternatives are represented by intervals of values, has a transitive strict component but an intransitive indifference relation.
