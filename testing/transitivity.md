#! Transitivity

The *transitivity axiom* for [[preference relation|preference relations]] states that for any three alternatives, $x$, $y$, and $z$, if $x$ is preferred to $y$ and $y$ to $z$ then also $x$ is preferred to $z$. Being a necessary condition for a relation to be represented by a utility function, it is widely employed and stands as one of the fundamental axioms of rationality.

>>! axiom* [transitivity|name=transitivity] A binary relation $\succcurlyeq$ over a set $X$ is *transitive* if for all $x,y,z \in X$, if $x \succcurlyeq y$ and $y \succcurlyeq z$ then $x \succcurlyeq z$.

Transitivity has a strong normative appeal; a DM whose preferences are intransitive is exposed to *dutch book* or *money pump* schemes that can extract her wealth.
